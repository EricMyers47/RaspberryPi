#  dpush- Syncronize directories using rsync (one way only)
#
#  This script syncronizes the current directory to a corresponding
#  directory  on the host $DSYNCHOST.  The directories must have the same
#  relative position under the $HOME directory on the two machines (or
#  they must both not be under $HOME, and absolute pathnames must be used).
#
#  Files listed in .dsync.exclude in the current directory are
#  excluded, if that file exists in the current directory or else in
#  the home directory.
#
#  In contrast to dsync, this is only a one-way transfer to the
#  server ($DSYNCHOST) from the client.  
#
#  This is just a simple application of the rsync command.  See rsync(1)
#  for further details.
