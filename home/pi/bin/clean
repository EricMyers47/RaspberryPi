#  clean - discarding files that YOU don't want
#
#  This script "deletes" selected files by moving them to
#  $HOME/.garbage.bin (so they can actually be recoverd, if needed).
#
#  Most of the files it deletes are things that most people don't care
#  to keep around - core files and old version files from editors.
#  You can easily modify the list of files by adding or removing the
#  appropriate lines clean_up lines.  
#
#  You can also store patterns naming particular files you want
#  deleted in a file called .cleanrc.  When clean is run from a
#  particular directory the .cleanrc in THAT directory is used (if it
#  exists). 
#
#  This script requires a Bourne shell (/bin/sh) which knows function
#  defintions.  Most do, but some old ones don't.  Try bash instead.
